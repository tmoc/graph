# graph

A graph package inspired by examples from Steven Skeina's excellent book The Algorithm Design Manual. This was built as a learning excercise and to unify the concepts into a single Go type that is easy to use and test.

## Concepts Covered

* Graph initialization
* Breadth-first traversal
* Depth-first traversal
* Finding connected components
* Determining if graph is bipartite
* Finding cycles
* Finding articulation vertices
* Topological sorting
* Finding strongly connected components

## Usage

See tests.
